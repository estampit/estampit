# Moodboard & Visual Inspiration

_Last updated: 2025-10-05_

Curated references for the landing page and owner dashboard refresh. Each entry captures key visual cues to replicate or reinterpret within the MYSTAMP brand.

## 1. Loyalty SaaS Competitors

| Brand | URL | What to Borrow | Notes |
|-------|-----|----------------|-------|
| FiveStars | https://www.fivestars.com/ | Hero device mockups, testimonial slider with logos, gradient overlays | Strong narrative with customer stories; replicate motion timing and subtle scroll parallax.
| Smile.io | https://smile.io/ | Pricing toggle, plan comparison tables, consistent illustration style | Clean typography + extensive social proof. Adapt color blocking to our palette.
| TapMango | https://www.tapmango.com/ | Dashboard screenshots in hero, feature icons | Use as reference for how to blend product UI into marketing sections.
| Loyalzoo | https://www.loyalzoo.com/ | Multi-step “How it works” with iconography, conversion-focused CTAs | Incorporate their approach to audience-specific messaging (restaurants vs salons).

## 2. Analytics Dashboards

| Product | URL | Inspiration | Notes |
|---------|-----|------------|-------|
| Linear | https://linear.app/ | Minimalist charts, command palette, dark mode toggle | Mirror their spacing hierarchy and keyboard-first interactions for owner dashboard.
| Retool | https://retool.com/ | Flexible tables with filters, dense data without clutter | Use as reference for TanStack Table styling and responsive layouts.
| Stripe Radar | https://stripe.com/radar | KPI cards with deltas, anomaly alerts | Emulate their card design for stamps/redemptions metrics.

## 3. Design Systems & Pattern Libraries

| Source | URL | Use Case |
|--------|-----|----------|
| Vercel Design | https://vercel.com/design | Gradient system, button/motion tokens |
| Tailwind UI | https://tailwindui.com/ | Form layouts, marketing sections (hero, pricing, FAQ) |
| Framer Motion Showcase | https://www.framer.com/motion/ | Micro-interactions (fade/slide, staggered lists) |

## 4. Color & Typography

- **Primary Palette**: Deep purple (#5A31F4), electric violet (#7B5CFF), amber accent (#FFC15A), soft gray (#F5F7FB).
- **Dashboard Accent**: Emerald (#2DD4BF) for positive growth, Coral (#FB7185) for decline alerts.
- **Typography**: Pair `Clash Display` (headings) with `Inter` (body). Alternative fallback: `Space Grotesk` + `Inter`.
- **Backgrounds**: Use layered gradient noise similar to [https://magicui.design/](https://magicui.design/).

## 5. Motion & Interaction Ideas

- Hero: autoplay Lottie of digital stamp card filling up; fallback to GIF for unsupported browsers.
- Scroll-triggered stats: counters animate when section enters viewport (react-use-intersection).
- Dashboard: chart tooltips with subtle spring animation; skeleton loaders with shimmer.
- CTA buttons: gradient border with hover glow and pressed state.

## 6. Imagery & Assets

- Commission or source 3D device mockups (phone & POS tablet) from [https://angle.sh/](https://angle.sh/) or [https://shots.so/](https://shots.so/).
- Use real café/bakery photography (Unsplash collections) for hero background overlays.
- Testimonials: ensure each quote has circular avatar, brand logo badge, rating stars.

## 7. Brand Voice Keywords

> **Human, data-backed, rewarding, celebratory, trustworthy**

All new copy and visuals should reflect these keywords. Keep CTAs oriented around immediate value (“Consigue más clientes hoy”) rather than generic “Learn more”.

## 8. Next Steps

1. Finalize palette & typography with brand stakeholders.
2. Produce wireframes integrating these references (Figma link TBD).
3. Generate initial illustration concepts using the referenced assets.
